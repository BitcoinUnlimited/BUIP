Prospective members are also asked to provide a public key which they will use for voting. Bitcoin Unlimited is a participatory organization where we do ask that devote a small amount of time, every couple of months to guide the direction of the software and org itself. (added by edit)

More links to external posting history are welcome, and I'll add them here. In the current adversarial climate the links prove helpful to existing members to make their evaluation.
