==Go "Bagatell Berserk"==

With the failure of the NYA network upgrade scheduled for Block 494,784, it has become increasingly clear that the BTC token has limited long term viability due to extremely high transaction fees and unreliable confirmations. This BUIP proposes to convert all BU's holdings in BTC to BCH.

We should tie BU to the mast and go down with the ship if BCH fails. If BCH succeeds, we will be better positioned to advance the bitcoin we love.

The trades would be carried out as soon as possible at the discretion of the President, Secretary and Lead Developer of BU (the three key holders). Coins will be stored in multisig wallets with keys held by the three BU officers at all points in time.

==Conflict of Interest==

The author holds both BTC and BCH tokens.
