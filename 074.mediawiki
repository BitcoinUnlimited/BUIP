==Summary==

Bitcoin Unlimited has no interest in providing support for the Bitcoin Gold fork, but has accrued Bitcoin Gold coins when BTG forked off the legacy BTC chain early this November.

This BUIP proposes to sell all Bitcoin Gold for BCH.

The trades would be carried out over the months December and January at the discretion of the President, Secretary and Lead Developer of BU (the three key holders). Coins will be stored in multisig wallets with keys held by the three BU officers at all points in time.
