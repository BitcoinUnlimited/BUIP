Motivation
----------

Bitcoin Unlimited needs a healthy voting participation. Many members
might not be very active on the forum and some have missed voting
announcements.

Objectives
----------

Implementing a system that will give people the possibility to check
less often and still be able to know about all voting dates.

Solution
--------

Voting dates will be published at least 12 months in advance. Members
would need to check not more than twice a year and mark the dates for
themselves. Setting the dates remains the discretion of the secretary
but there need to be a minimum of 4 dates per calendar year. The
blank-voting dates of Switzerland
(https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/vab\_1\_3\_3\_1.html) could be used
as a reference.

Task
----

The BU Articles document, Article 2, IV will be amended with he
following:

Voting dates are published at least 12 months advance notice on the BU
communication channels. Each calendar year shall have no less than 4
voting dates spread over the whole year. Dates can be removed if they
are not yet within the advance notice window. If there is no BUIP ready
for voting on a predefined date than the voting will not take place and
the date will not rescheduled. The predefined dates can be used for
votes, elections or both at the same date.
