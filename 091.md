    BUIP091: Move the official BU repository and issue tracker to GitLab
    Propser: Gal Buki (@torusJKL)

Background
----------

The BU code and the issue tracker is kept on GitHub under the URL
<https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/>.

Motivation
----------

GitHub is a closed environment. Although it is easy to clone a git
repository all the issue tracking and discussions on it can't be
exported. As a project that values [free and open source software
(FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "wikilink")
a platform that is open should be used instead.

Goal
----

The source code and issue tracking should be moved to a hosted
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/ "wikilink") repository. (If at any
time in the future BU wants to move to a self hosted GitLab instance all
data can be exported from the hosted GitLab repository)

Tasks
-----

1.  Move all code and issues to GitLab.
2.  Change links pointing to the GitHub repository to the new GitLab
    repository

Timetable
---------

The goal is to have moved by the end of the calendar year 2018.

Caveats
-------

The lead developer can organize the move himself or apoint another BU
member to be in charge. Choosing the namespace is left to the lead
developer together with the person in charge. Should the free hosting
solution not provide enough features then a plan can be chosen with a
total cost of up to USD 100/month (billed annually), the plan needs to
be approved by the BU president before purchased.
