==Motivation==

EDIT 1 September, 2018: Just to be clear, this is a proposal to set the default value of EB (Excessive Blocksize) to 10 terabyte. The user may adjust this value up or down.

The motivation of this proposal is to move the judgement of what max blocksize cap is safe from Bitcoin Unlimited to the individual miners.

The size of how large blocks a miner will or can accept should be a matter of competition. Not a green light from developers for what's safe for everybody, no matter how little you invest in hardware and network connections.

Competition in this space have the potential to drive development. Specialized software and hardware (GPU, ASIC) for transaction handling will develop faster under competitive conditions.

Finally, I'd like to quote Gavin Andresen on the topic:

<blockquote>Yes, let's eliminate the limit. Nothing bad will happen if we do. And if I'm wrong, the bad things would be mild annoyances, not existential risks, much less risky than operating a network near 100% capacity.</blockquote>
