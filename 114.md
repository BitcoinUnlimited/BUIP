    BUIP114: Drop support for the BSV HF Config Parameters in BUCash
    Proposer: Griffith 
    Submitted on: 2019-03-27
    Status: passed

Summary
-------

The purpose of this BUIP is to determine if BU is to continue to release
clients supporting BSV HF of BCH

Proposal
--------

BSV HF should no longer be supported by BU in future releases in the BCH
client.

In the event that this BUIP passes, I will be charged with the task of
making a PR that will remove BSV specific features from the BUCash
client on Github. Before my PR removing BSV specific features is merged,
a new branch should named BSV should be made to preserve the current
release with the BSV features. The new BSV branch will be a snapshot of
the current dev branch unless it is deemed unstable by The Developer in
which case the snapshot will be of the current release branch.
