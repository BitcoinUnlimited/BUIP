    BUIP137: Funded Development, aka Devpool3
    Proposer: Andrew Clifford
    Submitted on: 2019-11-09
    Status: draft

Motivation
----------

The same motivation still exists as we saw with Devpool and Devpool2.
The practice of funding development authorised on a per project basis
through directed BUIPs removes a lot of flexibility for general
maintenance, housekeeping, refactoring, QA, none of which is
functionally significant warranting a BUIP. Further, some BUIPs are
passed authorising changes but do not have directed funding included.

Objectives
----------

The objective of this proposal is to enable further funding of project
development, short-name "Devpool3", at the discretion of the Bitcoin
Unlimited lead Developer.

Project Duration
----------------

The funds authorised on this BUIP are for a maximum of one year. Any
unspent funds revert to the consolidated fund, and a subsequent BUIP
will need to be approved to continue funded development for a further
year.

Project Team
------------

Developers who wish to offer their services for project work are invited
to PM the BU Developer directly on this forum or make contact via
GitHub. Developers being paid are contractors who are responsible for
their own accounting and tax reporting. Payment will be offered in
either BCH or BTC, but not in fiat currency.

Summary of Approved Projects
----------------------------

1.  Passed BUIPs automatically qualify.
2.  General maintenance, housekeeping, refactoring, QA and other
    discretionary work also qualify.

Description of Activities
-------------------------

The BU Developer has oversight of the projects, and work parcels, he
allocates or executes work within project descriptions which he drafts
and posts to this forum for general information.

Anticipated Challenges and Uncertainties

Standard development issues only.

Budget
------

The budget for the development pool \#3 is $60,000. This is equivalent
to a projected average of $80 per hour for 750 hours. It is expected
that one or more funded projects will be active, depending upon
circumstances.

The BU President and Secretary will co-authorise drawdown of these funds
at the recommendation of the BU Developer when contracted developer
invoices are presented for work completed. All projects to be
individually named and separated in the annual accounts.

Impact
------

Bitcoin Unlimited's software has long been recognized as pushing the
boundaries of on-chain scaling. The overall quality of BU development is
expected to be improved by this initiative, also resulting in an
accelerated rate of improvement, especially as the next bull market is
likely to see an influx of users who are frustrated by the lack of BTC
scalability.
